README

This file aims to give the reader an understanding of the anatomy of the csdk sample application, its component 
parts and the means to build the project and deploy onto an android device

Core Directories
----------------

For a more detailed explanation of the anatomy of android projects please consult
http://developer.android.com/studio/projects/index.html

* app/src/main/java - The source code that constitutes the function of the sample application

* app/libs - Contains private Java libraries that the application utilizes

* app/src/main/jniLibs - Contains JNI (Java Native Interface) libraries that the application needs

* app/src/main/res - Contains application resources, such as drawable files, layout files and 
string values that the application uses

* build, app/build - Contain the files auto generated by Android framework
    
* docs - Contains all java docs for the client SDK

* build.gradle - Builds the sample project. See './gradlew tasks' for complete list of tasks

* app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml - Describes certain qualities about the activities, services,
intent receivers and content providers, what permissions are requested, etc.

Building A Debug Project
------------------------

Pre-requisite:

Ensure that you have Android Studio 3.0 installed. Building the sample app may work with other
versions of Android Studio but this has not been tested and compatibility is not guaranteed.

During installation of Android Studio, you may be prompted for an Android SDK location. If so,
please pay attention to any warning that the SDK location should not contain whitespace by
specifying a location that follows that rule if necessary.

Open the root project directory (that which contains the app directory) by clicking on "Open an
existing Android Studio project".

If you see Gradle warnings, they will probably be related to the absence of Android SDK 23 and
Android Tools 26.0.2 on your system. Follow the prompts to install these requirements. The
warnings you would commonly see would be as follows:

Gradle 'fusion_client_android_sdk-x.y.z' project refresh failed
        Failed to find target with hash string 'android-23' in: C:\android-sdk
    ! Error:
        Consult IDE log for more details (Help | Show Log)
        Install missing platform(s) and sync project <----------- CLICK HERE and follow the prompts

then:

Gradle 'fusion_client_android_sdk-x.y.z' project refresh failed
        Failed to find Build Tools revision 26.0.2
    ! Error:
        Install Build Tools 26.0.2 and sync project <----------- CLICK HERE and follow the prompts

It should now be possible to build the sample app. If you have an Android device connected to your
computer and developer mode has been enabled on that device, it should be possible to install the
sample app upon that device and run it.
